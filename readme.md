#Our Inspiration
Tired of such superficial apps like Tinder - based on physical appearance and nothing else? We want to try something that really connects people with each other, based on their interests and personalities. While you are driving, cooking or maybe working you can record a voice message and find the person that might be your soul mate!

#What is it good for?
Basically, you can record short voice message on a daily basis telling a funny, crazy, interesting....seeexy story about your day available on the network for 24 hours. If someone is attracted by your voice or your story, he or she will just say a YES. And, if you give a YES back - you got a match!! Now you can reply with a new voice message and start a vocal date <3 Every YES you say will train a SOM neural network that will help you to get messages from people with voices you'll probably like. The most you use the app, the highest is the chance you will get in touch with sexy voices you like! 

Tired of writing and making typo errors? Just talk to Alexa.

#How we built it
The Alexa App is built with the Alexa Skills Kit and the business logic (Node JS, cause Node is awesome!) is hosted by the awesome guys  from Swisscom - Thank You for that .

A Self Organizing Map is trained with pre-processed signals of Swiss German voices messages. The clustering allows to identify the similarities between different voices and asses if a new voice sample could be appreciate by the user.

#Challenges we ran into
The dataset provided was way too small to obtain a network with good generalization capabilities. Further more a backend developer might have given us some more hours of sleep.

#Accomplishments that we're proud of
Four hours of sleep in three days and our brains are still working  (partially). Using our passion about machine learning to make people fall in love (and not in a superficial way!) is great :)

#What we learned
The Alexa environment is awesome and a ton of fun to hack with! Hackathons are amazing opportunities to meet lots of smart and crazy people with amazing ideas and no fear to realize them.

#What's next for LoveVibes
From a business perspective LoveVibes is a great opportunity to collect trainig data in swiss german in a rather high quality. With the help of manual annotaitions you can train some neural networks to translate spoken swiss german in written high german.
